                Intro to Scuba Diving
            </h2>

            <div>
                Scuba diving is a mode of underwater diving where the diver uses a self-contained underwater 
                breathing apparatus (scuba), which is completely independent of surface supply, to breathe 
                underwater. Scuba divers carry their own source of breathing gas, usually compressed air, 
                allowing them greater independence and freedom of movement than surface-supplied divers, 
                and longer underwater endurance than breath-hold divers.
                <br>
                Scuba diving may be done recreationally or professionally in a number of applications, 
                including scientific, military and public safety roles, but most commercial diving uses 
                surface-supplied diving equipment when this is practicable. Scuba divers engaged in armed 
                forces covert operations may be referred to as frogmen, combat divers or attack swimmers. A 
                scuba diver primarily moves underwater by using fins attached to the feet, but external
                propulsion can be provided by a diver propulsion vehicle, or a sled pulled from the surface.

                    Sharks kill 8 to 12 people each year world wide. Humans kill over 30 million sharks each year.

                    According to Divers Alert Network (DAN), the 2010 fatality rate in scuba diving was one death 
                    for every 211,864 dives. Compare that to one death in 126,626 for marathon runners.

                    The world record for a deep dive on a standard, open-circuit scuba system was 1,044 feet, 
                    by South African diver Nuno Gomes, in 2005 off of Dahab, Egypt. The dive took 12 hours and 
                    20 minutes, of which only 14 minutes were used on the descent<br>

                    Children can learn to dive as young as 8 – the limitng factor is that they must be able to manage the 
                    weight of the equipment.

                    Finding Nemo was without the doubt one of the most successful and memorable Pixar movie. 
                    And the art team didn’t leave anything to chance. To understand the underwater world better, 
                    they took scuba diving courses in oceanography, marine biology and more.<br>

                    The longest warm-water dive on a standard, open-circuit scuba system was done in the summer of 
                    2013, when a British man, Sean McGahern, spent 49 hours and 56 minutes on the bottom of the 
                    Mediterranean off Malta. He kept himself entertained by cleaning the seabed of debris
