                Intro to Sky Diving
            </h2>

            <div>
                Skydiving, also called parachuting, use of a parachute—for either recreational or competitive 
                purposes—to slow a diver’s descent to the ground after jumping from an airplane or other high place.
                <br>
                It may involve more or less free-falling (the skydiving segment) which is a period when the parachute 
                has not yet been deployed and the body gradually accelerates to terminal velocity.
                <br>
                The sport traces its beginnings to the descents made from a hot-air balloon by the French aeronaut 
                André-Jacques Garnerin in 1797, but modern skydiving is usually performed from a propeller-driven 
                airplane. At events such as the annual World Free Fall Convention in Quincy, Illinois, however, 
                parachutists are afforded the opportunity to jump from such diverse craft as hot-air balloons, 
                helicopters, and a Boeing 727.

            <h2>Some Facts about Sky Diving</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    A little device "Automatic Activation Device" deploys our parachutes in the worst cases
                    when we  can't open out parachute ourselves.

                    You must prove that you've made at least 200 jumps before you can make a Wingsuit Jump.<br>

                <li>
                    It is estimated that during the time of a free fall, the wind that travels past your ear 
                    is over 100 mph. This means that you are deaf to most sounds that you might want to hear 
                    during a free fall.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is estimated that well over 2 million skydives takes place every year. Also, it is 
                    important to note that out of these skydives; the fatalities average around 35 which can 
                    be worked out to less than 1% of all the jumps that occur during the year.

                <li>
                    In the year 2006, around 400 divers from as many as 31 countries took just about 80 seconds 
                    to form a flower arrangement in the sky. This feat was accomplished at a height of a little 
                    over 23,000 ft.<br>

                    Fred Mack, at the age of 100 years, was the oldest person to skydive. He promised he would do 
                    it after completing a century, and he stayed true to his word. He truly serves as a massive 
                    inspiration.

                <li>
                    Toni Stadler from the country of South Africa was the youngest person to skydive at the age 
                    of four. He accomplished this feat from an altitude of 10,000 feet.

                    Michael Zang created a new world record by completing 500 jumps in a single day. 
                    He completed this in intervals of less than 3 minutes.

                    Georgina Broadwick, in 1913, was the first woman to jump with the aid of a parachute from 
                    an aircraft. This feat was accomplished over Los Angeles. It is fitting that she performed 
                    such a daredevil act over the ‘City of Angels’. Why should men have all the fun?<br>

                    After flying to an altitude of more than 128,000 feet (39,000 meters) in a helium-filled balloon, 
                    Red Bull Stratos pilot Felix Baumgartner completed a record breaking skydive on October 14, 2012 from 
                    the edge of space. During his 4:20 freefall, Felix reached a maximum speed of 833mph (1,342.8 km/h), 
                    which set a new world record as the first human in history to break the sound barrier with his body!
