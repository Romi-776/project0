            What is Sports?
        </h2>

        <p class="explaination">
            <strong><defn>Sport</defn></strong> includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which, through casual or organized
            participation, at least in part aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while 
            providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for spectators. Sports can bring 
            positive results to one's physical health. Sports is also governed by a set of specific rules or customs that 
            are needed to be followed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of 
            simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. 
            In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with 
            one winner; in others, the contest is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports 
            allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure 
            one winner and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. 
            Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, 
            followed in some cases by playoffs.
