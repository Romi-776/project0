                What is Sports?
            </h2>

            <p>
                <strong>Sport</strong> includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which, through casual or organized
                participation, at least in part aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while
                providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for spectators. Sports can bring
                positive results to one's physical health. Sports is also governed by a set of specific rules or customs that
                are needed to be followed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of
                simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals.
                In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with
                one winner; in others, the contest is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports
                allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure
                one winner and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion.
                Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season,
                followed in some cases by playoffs.

                My favourite ones:
            </h2>

            These are the sports that I like, and some usefull information about them:

            <div >
                <h2 id="football">
                    <a href="football.html">Football</a>
                </h2>

                <img src="Football.jpg" alt="Football" title="Also called 'SOCCER' is a team game in which the players are
                required to kick the ball into a net called 'GOAL'." width=700>

                <p>
                    Football is my favourite sport. I had played it a lot. Its one those games that requires a lot
                    of strength and <br>stamina and I am always ready to play it. While playing it, I feels a great. I had
                    enjoyed every moment of<br> playing it.
                </p>

                <h2 id="cricket">
                    <a href="cricket.html">Cricket</a>
                </h2>

                <img src="Cricket.jpg" alt="Cricket" title="Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field" width=700>

                <p>
                    Cricket is one of the games that I had played at the time when I was a kid.<br>
                    It is also the most popular sport in India. The craze of
                    IPL and the crowd in the stadiums during the
                    IPL season was one of the amazing things to experience in India.

                <h2 id="scuba">
                    <a href="scuba.html">Scuba Diving</a>
                </h2>

                <img src="Scuba.jpg" alt="Scuba Diving" title="It is the sport or activity of swimming underwater using a scuba(vessel to store air for breathing)." width=700>

                <p>
                    Although, I hadn't done it yet and also I don't know how to swim but its one of my wish or we say a
                    dream to Scuba dive. <br>I sometimes think about it that how does it feel to go underwater deep inside the ocean,
                    see fishes floating <br>around you and how the world under the see looks like.<br>
                    If there's a chance to do it then I will never gonna miss it
                    at any cost.
                </p>

                        <a href="sky.html">Sky Diving</a>
                    </h2>

                    <img src="sky.jpg" alt="Sky Diving" title="It is the sport or activity of jumping from an aircraft and performing acrobatic manoeuvres in the air under free fall before landing by parachut." width=700>

                    <p>
                        This is also a sport that I hadn't done it yet and its one of my wish to do atleast once in the lifetime. <br>
                        I want to feel that air flowing around me at an incredible speed which would be an incredible experience. <br>
                        I am thrilled about it and also sometimes had day dreamed about it. So let's see if I am going to get a chance to
                        do it or not.<br>
                        Hope for the best!
