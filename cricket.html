                    Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a 
                    field at the centre of which is a 20-metre pitch with a wicket at each end, each 
                    comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by 
                    striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat, while the bowling and fielding 
                    side tries to prevent this and dismiss each player. Means of dismissal include being 
                    bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side 
                    catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground. When ten 
                    players have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles.
