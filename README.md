    Since I like sports a lot so i had made this project on sports. It will give information about some types of sports and
    sports that I like the most. Also I had given my views on my favourite sports and had made each individual page only for 
    the sports that I like. All the pages are interconnected with each other so that the user can go to any page with just a
    click on the button/link.
